    <h2>The World's Best Fazool</h2>

    <p>Pasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>
   
    <h3>List of Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Yellow Onions</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Swiss Chard</li>
        <li>Cannellini</li>
        <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.</li>
        <li>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese.</li>
